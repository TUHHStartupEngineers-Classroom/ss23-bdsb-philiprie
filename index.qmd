Welcome! This website functions as the lab journal for the Business Data Science Basics module. In the menu above you can find the journals I have prepared for the four different chapters and the challenges each presented. I hope that the results presented match the criteria for passing this class, some challenges turned out to be quite tough, but overall they helped in the understanding and were interesting. I had some difficulties with the last challenge, where a world map was to be plotted, I hope that is not an issue.

I did not alter the files for the Class notes nor the Links.
